graphql-testx is a full featured GraphQL server, with minimum configuration required,
based on Graphback and Apollo Server, used for testing GraphQL client applications or
libraries. It should not be confused with mocking alternatives because graphql-testx
offers persistent data between queries and mutation using in-memory SQLite database.

## Examples
