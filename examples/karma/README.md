# graphql-testx-karma-example

This example is testing a generic application using graphql-testx and
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)

The Karma example is using `TestxController` in combination with the
`TestxDirector` in order to control the `TestxServer` from within the browser.
Learn more in [TestxController documentation](../../README.md#TestxController)

To try the example:

```bash
yarn install
yarn test
```
